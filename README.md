# üåê Universal Protocol Vision (UPV)

> A modular, ethical and open framework to connect all systems, languages and people.

The **Universal Protocol Vision (UPV)** is a proposal for a new era of digital interoperability.  
It is not just a technical protocol ‚Äî it's a philosophical and architectural foundation for how different systems, platforms, and individuals can communicate across barriers, technologies, and contexts.

## üîç What is UPV?

UPV is a modular framework composed of independent but interoperable layers.  
It enables true understanding between:

- Programming languages
- Financial platforms
- Healthcare systems
- Educational tools
- Governments
- Media ecosystems
- AI agents
- ...and more

The core purpose: **make systems and people "understand" each other** through semantic, ethical and federated communication.

## üß± Architecture Overview

| Module        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **UPV-Core**   | Semantic foundation ‚Äî types, events, units, and base logic |
| **UPV-Lang**   | Bridges logic and structure between programming languages |
| **UPV-Data**   | Context-aware and user-consented data portability |
| **UPV-Finance**| Secure, auditable and inclusive financial communication |
| **UPV-Media**  | Interoperability for media, metadata, ownership and authorship |
| **UPV-Bridge** | Compatibility layer for legacy systems and old APIs |

> A visual diagram of this architecture will be available in `media/architecture-diagram.png` (coming soon)
